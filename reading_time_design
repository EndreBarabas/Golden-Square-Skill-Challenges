1. Describe the problem
   As a user
   So that I can improve my grammar
   I want to verify that a text starts with a capital letter and ends with a suitable   sentence-ending punctuation mark.

2. Design the method signature
   is_correct = grammar_check(string)
   

3. Create examples as tests
   grammar_check("")
   #fail: empty string
   
   grammar_check("I don't speak Spanish.")
   True

   grammar_check("speak like on msn")
   False
   

   
4. Implement the behaviour
